Dictionaries
Why are dictionaries necessary? Why not use a list?
-because you can index using keys instead of numbers and lookup time is very fast

How is the lookup time in a dictionary different from that of a list?
-the lookup time for a dictionary is much faster because you just have to look for the key not loop over every item
    to see if it's the key

How do you create an empty dictionary? How do you create a dictionary with initial content?
-you create an empty dictionary by setting whatever you want your dictionary name as equal to {}. You can create an
    inital dictionary with values by entering your_dictionary = {key1: 'value', key2: 'value'}

How do you add a new key/value pair to a dictionary? How do you update the value of a key in a dictionary?
-you add a new key:value pair by saying dictionary['key']= value
-you update the value of a dictionary by saying dictionary['key'] = value (it will update not add)

How do you remove a key/value pair from a dictionary?
-you delete an item by entering del dictionary['key']

How do you look up the value for a given key in a dictionary?
-you look up the value by typing dictionary['key'] and value will be returned

How do you iterate over a dictionary?
-you can iterate over dictionary using a foor loop, it will get each key

Print keys?
-for item in dictionary:
    print(item)

Print values?
-for item in dictionary:
    print(dictionary[item])

Print keys and values?
-dictionary.items()
    for key, value in dictionary.items():
        print(f'{key}: {value})

What is a KeyError? When does one occur?
-key error occurs when attempting to index into a dictionary with a non existant key
    can avoid by using dict.get()

Dictionary methods to know:

.get()
-dictionary.get('key', value_if_not_there)
    returns value_if_not_there

.values()
-dictionary.values():
    for value in dictionary.values():
    print(value)

.items()
-for key, value in dictionary.items():
    print(f'{key}: {value})

How do you access a dictionary within a dictionary?
-dictionary[main_key][key_within_main_key]

When should you use a dictionary?
-when you want to store information accessible by key (name to data, first string letter to list of words
    with that letter, word paired with opposite word), for counting

What is the shell environment?

What is the $PATH environment variable? What role does it play on the command line?

How can you access the shell environment in Python?

How do you set environment variables using a .sh file?



Python Projects
What is a Python module?

What is a namespace?

What are the 3 ways to import something in Python?

Why is from some_module import * not a good practice?

When should you import a whole library versus only one function, class, etc.?

What does if __name__ == "__main__" ask? When should you include this check at the bottom of your file?

Where are the three places that you can import things from?

What is pip?

Why are virtual environments necessary?

How do you create a virtual environment? How do you activate it?

What command can you use to view the currently installed Python libraries?

What should you name the file that has the list of a Python project’s dependencies?



Classes
How are classes different than dictionaries in terms of structure, flexibility, and data storage?

What is the relationship between a class and an instance?

What is instantiation?

What are attributes? How do you define an attribute at the class level (to be shared by all instances)? How do you set a new attribute on an instance? How can you update the value of an attribute on an instance?

What is a method? How do you define a method on a class? How do you call a method?

What are the key differences between functions and methods?

What is initialization? How is it different than instantiation?

What is __init__? When does it get called?

What is encapsulation? What is abstraction? What is polymorphism?

What is inheritance? When is it appropriate for one class to inherit attributes and/or methods from another?

What are the various ways in which a child class can modify methods and attributes from a parent class?

What is super()?

What’s an example of violating polymorphism? What’s an example of enforcing polymorphism?

When overriding parent methods, what is the only method that is normal to require different arguments than the parent method?

What is an abstract class? What makes it different than a typical class?

When there are methods that don’t directly map to an existing hierarchy, how can you continue to pursue encapsulation? (i.e. avoid copying the same method on several classes)
